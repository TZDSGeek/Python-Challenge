# Python-Challenge
Python Module 3 Assignment
During this project I definitley ran into some areas where I required the assitance of either past examples of either assingment, a tutor, and AskBCS for some troubleshooting when the code wasn't functioning as intended, and I couldn't find any fixes during my research.
For PyBank in particular, I researched and applied the csv.DictReader module, a method that wasn't taught specifically in this course. I decided to go this route rather than the apply the method we were taught, because I wanted to challenge myself and get more practice applying the dictionary module in new ways since it is so crucial for API's, a topic that I am very excited to learn about! There were also several instances when I copied and pasted comments or common steps from PyBank to PyPoll (i.e reading the CSV file or printing my results).
